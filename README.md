# OPEN-SOURCE STREAMING SITE
<br>
This is a heavy moodification of a personal project I started in high school for movie streaming. It is based on <a href="https://codepen.io/leab/pen/wWQGzj/">this</a>
<br>
My version is very watered down, but I think it creates a great, reponsive template with minimal code.
